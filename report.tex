\section{Introduction}

In many universities, students are still required to visit banks physically to pay their semester fees. This traditional method is time-consuming, inconvenient, and often involves long queues and manual paperwork. As a result, students waste valuable academic time and face unnecessary stress.

Additionally, most official university notices and updates are shared through Facebook groups. Many students miss important information because they do not regularly check social media, or important posts get buried among other content. This creates communication gaps between the university and students.

To solve these problems, an online system is proposed that allows students to pay fees digitally and receive all official notifications in one platform.

\section{Overview of the System}

The proposed system is a web-based and mobile-friendly platform designed for university students and administrators. It will provide a centralized system for fee payment, academic document access, and official communication.

\subsection{Student Features}

Students will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pay semester fees using digital payment services such as bKash and Nagad
    \item Receive automatic digital payment receipts
    \item Download admit cards online
    \item View official university notices and announcements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Administrator Features}

University administrators will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Manage student payment records
    \item Verify transactions
    \item Upload notices and announcements
    \item Generate reports
\end{itemize}

The system will ensure secure transactions, accurate record-keeping, and easy access to important information.

\section{Objectives and Scope}

\subsection{Objectives}

The main objectives of this system are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To reduce the need for physical bank visits
    \item To save time and effort for students and staff
    \item To provide a secure and reliable online payment system
    \item To ensure that students receive all important notices on time
    \item To digitize administrative processes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}

The scope of this system includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Online fee payment using bKash and Nagad
    \item Automatic generation of digital receipts
    \item Admit card download facility
    \item Centralized notice board
    \item User authentication for students and administrators
    \item Payment and notice management system
\end{itemize}

The system does not cover academic grading, course registration, or learning management features in its initial version.
