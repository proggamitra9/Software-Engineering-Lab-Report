\section{Introduction}

In many universities, students are still required to visit banks physically to pay their semester fees. This traditional method is time-consuming, inconvenient, and often involves long queues and manual paperwork. As a result, students waste valuable academic time and face unnecessary stress.

Additionally, most official university notices and updates are shared through Facebook groups. Many students miss important information because they do not regularly check social media, or important posts get buried among other content. This creates communication gaps between the university and students.

To solve these problems, an online system is proposed that allows students to pay fees digitally and receive all official notifications in one platform.
